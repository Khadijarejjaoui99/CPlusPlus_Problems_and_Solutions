<h3>solution:</h3>
<p>var-card-info.cpp</p>
<h3>Problem 2:</h3>
<p>Write a program that declare variables num1, num2, and num3 where num1 = 20, num2 = 30, and num3 = 10. Calculate their sum and store it in a variable called total and print them as following:</p>
<img src = "variables-p2.PNG" alt = "variable problem 2">
<h3>solution:</h3>
<p>var-sum-operation.cpp</p>
<h3>Problem 3:</h3>
<p>Consider that the age is equal now to 25 years old print the age after 5 years like the following:</p>
