<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>
Write a program that defines a structure called stRectangle with members Length and Width (both of type int). The program should have the following functions:

ReadRectangleData: This function reads the length and width of a rectangle from the user.
CalculateArea: This function calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
CalculatePerimeter: This function calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
DisplayRectangleData: This function displays the length, width, area, and perimeter of the rectangle.
The program should create an array of two Rectangle structures, read the data for each rectangle, and display the data for both rectangles.

</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>rectangle.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>
Write a program that defines a structure called stBook with members title and author (both of type string). The program should have the following functions:

ReadBookData: This function reads the title and author of a book from the user.
SwapBooks: This function takes two Book structures as input and swaps their contents.
DisplayBookData: This function displays the title and author of a book.
The program should create two Book structures, read the data for the first book, read the data for the second book, swap their contents, and display the data for both books.

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>books.cpp</p>
