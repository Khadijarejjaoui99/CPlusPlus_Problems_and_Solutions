## structures-and-enums

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>
 Write a program using struct to do the following (The data should be taken
from the user).
</p>
<img src = "problem.PNG" alt = "problem image">
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>info-card-v1.cpp</p>
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>
Repeat the previous problem, but this time add structure another structure by adding address information, and contact information
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>info-card-v2.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>
instead of using char for gender and boolean for isMarried use enums in info-card-v1.cpp, but this time hardcode the inputs
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>info-card-v3.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>
Design a program that defines a struct called "Book" with the following members:

title (string)
author (string)
publicationYear (int)
Create two instances of the "Book" struct and print their details.

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>book-details.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>
Design a program that defines a struct called "Student" with the following members:
name (string)
age (int)
GPA (float)
Create three instances of the "Student" struct and print their details.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>student-details.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>
Create a program that defines a struct called "Car" with the following members:

brand (string)
model (string)
year (int)
Define another struct called "Person" with the following members:
name (string)
age (int)
car (Car)
Create an instance of the "Person" struct and assign values to its members. Print the person's name, age, and the details of their car.

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>person-car.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>
Design a struct called "Point" that represents a point in a 2D coordinate system with x and y coordinates as its members. Initialize two Point objects and calculate the distance between them using the Euclidean distance formula: sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). Print the distance on the screen.

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>calculate-distance.cpp</p>
