Write a program that defines a structure called Rectangle with members length and width (both of type int). The program should have the following functions:

ReadRectangleData: This function reads the length and width of a rectangle from the user.
CalculateArea: This function calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
CalculatePerimeter: This function calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
DisplayRectangleData: This function displays the length, width, area, and perimeter of the rectangle.
The program should create an array of two Rectangle structures, read the data for each rectangle, and display the data for both rectangles.
