## for-loop

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>
Write a program that ask the user to enter his/her age and ask him/her if has a
driver's license.
Then print "Hired" if his/her age is greater than 21 years old and she/he has a
driver's license, otherwise print "Rejected".
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>hired-rejected.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>
Write a program that ask the user to enter a mark, then print "Pass" if the
mark is greater or equal to 50 , otherwise print fail
<br>Example Input:
<br>80
<br>Output:
<br>Pass
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>pass-fail.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>
Write a program to ask the user to enter 3 marks, then print average of the
entered marks, if the average >= 50 print "Pass" otherwise print "Fail" .
<br>Example Input:
<br>50
<br>60
<br>70
<br>Output:
<br>60
"Pass"
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>pass-fail-average.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>
 Write a program to ask the user to enter his/ her age. If the age is between 18
and 45 print "Valid Age" otherwise print "Invalid Age"
<br>Example Input:
<br>30
<br>Output:
Valid Age
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>valid-age.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>
Write a program to read ATM PIN code from the user, then check if the PIN
code = 1234, then show the balance to the user, otherwise print "Wrong PIN" and
Assume user balance is 7800.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>atm-pin.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>
Write a program to ask the user to enter his/ her mark and print his/her grade.
<br>90 - 100 Print A.
<br>70 - 89 Print B.
<br>50 - 69 Print C.
<br>Otherwise Print F
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>grades.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>
Write a program to ask the user to enter TotalSales and print the commission.
The commission is calculated as percentage * the total sale amount.
<br>>= 1000000 -> percentage is 3%
<br>>= 100K and < 1000000 -> percentage is 1%
Otherwise -> percentage 0%
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>commission.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>
Write a program to ask the user to enter two numbers and operation type.
<br>"+" Add two numbers
<br>"-" Subtract two numbers
<br>"*" Multiply two numbers
"/" Divide two numbers
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>arithmatic-operation.cpp</p>

<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p>
Write a program to ask the user to enter day number and print the day name.
<br>1 print Sunday
<br>2 print Monday
<br>3 print Tuesday
<br>4 print Wednesday
<br>5 print Thursday
<br>6 print Friday
7 print Saturday

</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>week-days.cpp</p>
