## Declaration And Initialization

Write a program to declare and intialize a vectore and print it.
<br> Output:
<br> 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90

## Add Element 1

Write a program to declare a vectore and add elements to it and print it.
<br> Output:
<br> 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90

## Add Element 2

Write a program to ask the user to enter as many numbers as s/he wants, each time the user enter a number it got added to the vector, and ask the user if s/he wants to enter more numbers, if no print the vector elements on the screen.
<br> Output Example:
<br> 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90

## struct vector

Example of vector of type struct
<br> Output Example:
<br> First Name: Khadija
<br>Last Name: Rejjoui
<br>Salary: 2000
<br>
<br>First Name: Zineb
<br>Last Name: Amine
<br>Salary: 3000

## struct vector2

Write a program to ask the user to enter as many employees as s/he wants, each time the user enter employee info it got added to the vector, and ask the user if s/he wants to enter more employees, if no print the vector elements on the screen.
<br> Output Example:
<br> First Name: Khadija
<br>Last Name: Rejjoui
<br>Salary: 2000
<br>
<br>First Name: Zineb
<br>Last Name: Amine
<br>Salary: 3000

## Remove element

Write a program that demonstrates various operations on two vectors: vNumbers1 and vNumbers2. Your task is to implement a C++ program that performs vector manipulation operations such as adding elements, removing elements using the pop_back() function, and clearing the vector using the clear() function.
<br>The program should perform the following steps:
<br>Declare two integer vectors, vNumbers1 and vNumbers2.
<br>Add the following integers to vNumbers1 using the push_back() function: 12, 20, 11, 40, 15.
<br>Print the elements of vNumbers1 using a custom function named PrintVector() that takes a reference to a vector as input and displays its contents.
<br>Display the size of vNumbers1 using the size() function.
<br>Use the pop_back() function twice on vNumbers1 to remove the last two elements.
<br>Print the elements of vNumbers1 again and display its size after the pop_back() operations.
<br>Add the following integers to vNumbers2 using the push_back() function: 3, 1, 14, 4, 100, 200.
<br>Print the elements of vNumbers2 using the PrintVector() function.
<br>Display the size of vNumbers2 using the size() function.
<br>Use the clear() function on vNumbers2 to remove all elements from the vector.
<br>Print the elements of vNumbers2 again and display its size after the clear() operation.

## vector functions:

write a porgram to do the following:
<br>1. Declare a vector vNumbers of integers and initialize it with the following elements: 11, 2, 3, 10, 33, 10, 8.
<br>2. Display the first element of the vector.
<br>3. Display the last element of the vector.
<br>4. Display the number of elements in the vector.
<br>5. Display the capacity of the vector.
<br>6. Check if the vector is empty or not.
