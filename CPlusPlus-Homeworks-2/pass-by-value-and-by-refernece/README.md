## pass by value

Write a program that demonstrates the concept of passing a variable by value to a function in C++. Your task is to create a program that declares a function named Function() and passes an integer variable a to it by value. Observe how the function affects the value of a.

## pass by reference

Write a program that demonstrates the concept of passing a variable by reference to a function in C++. Your task is to create a program that declares a function named Function() and passes an integer variable a to it by reference. Observe how the function affects the value of a.

## create reference

Write a C++ program that demonstrates the concept of references. Your task is to declare an integer variable a and a reference x that refers to the same memory location as a. Observe the behavior of the reference when changes are made to both x and a.
<br>Your program should follow these steps:
<br>Declare an integer variable a and initialize it with the value 10.
<br>Declare an integer reference x and initialize it to reference a. This means that x is an alias for a, and any changes made to x will affect a.
<br>Display the memory addresses of a and x using appropriate output statements.
<br>Display the values of a and x using appropriate output statements.
<br>Apply changes to the reference x by assigning it the value 30.
<br>Display the updated values of a and x after the change.
<br>Apply changes directly to variable a by assigning it the value 100.
<br>Display the updated values of a and x after the change.
