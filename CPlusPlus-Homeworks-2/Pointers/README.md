## Declare pointer

Write a C++ program that declares an integer variable a, initializes it with a value, displays its value and address, and uses a pointer to store and display the memory address of a.

## Dereferencing:

Write a program that declares an integer variable a and a pointer ptr. The pointer ptr should be initialized to point to the memory address of variable a. The program should display the value of a, the value of the pointer ptr, and the value stored at the memory address that ptr is pointing to. After that, change the value of the variable a using the pointer ptr, and display the updated value of a, the value of the pointer ptr, and the value stored at the memory address that ptr is pointing to, try also to change the value of a.

## Call by reference using pointer:

Swap two variables using pointers.

## Array and pointer

Declare an array and a pointer, let the pointer point to the array and print addresses of the elements of the array and their values using pointer.

## Struct and pointer

Write a program that defines a structure stEmployee representing employee details, including their name and salary. The program should create a structure variable Employee1 and a pointer ptr to the structure type. The Employee1 variable should be initialized with a name "Khadija Rejjaoui" and a salary of 5000. The program should display the name and salary of Employee1 using regular variable access. Then, it should use the pointer ptr to access and display the name and salary of Employee1. After that, change the values of Employee1 using the pointer ptr, and display the updated name and salary using the pointer.

## void and pointer

Write a program that demonstrates the use of a void pointer to manipulate different data types. Declare an integer variable x and a float variable y. Create a void pointer ptr and use it to point to the memory address of x. Display the address stored in the pointer ptr. Change the value of x using the void pointer, and display the updated value of x and the value pointed to by the void pointer(which is value of x). Then, let the void pointer ptr point to the memory address of y, which is of type float. Display the address stored in the pointer ptr, the original value of y, and the value pointed to by the void pointer (which is the value of y).
