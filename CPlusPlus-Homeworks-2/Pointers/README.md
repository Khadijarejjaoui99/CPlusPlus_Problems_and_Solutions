## Declare pointer

Write a C++ program that declares an integer variable a, initializes it with a value, displays its value and address, and uses a pointer to store and display the memory address of a.

## Dereferencing:

Write a program that declares an integer variable a and a pointer ptr. The pointer ptr should be initialized to point to the memory address of variable a. The program should display the value of a, the value of the pointer ptr, and the value stored at the memory address that ptr is pointing to. After that, change the value of the variable a using the pointer ptr, and display the updated value of a, the value of the pointer ptr, and the value stored at the memory address that ptr is pointing to, try also to change the value of a.

## Call by reference using pointer:

Swap two variables using pointers.
