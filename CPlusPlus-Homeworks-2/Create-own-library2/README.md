## Problem 1: Fill Array With Random Numbers From 1 To 100

Write a program to N numbers and fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 and print the array.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array:
10
Array Elements: 71 56 45 27 56 96 87 42 90 13

## Problem2: Find Maximum Number In An Array:

Write a program to N numbers and fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 the print max element
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array:
10
Array Elements: 38 30 100 100 17 99 46 91 55 31
Max Number is: 100

## Problem3: Find Minimum Number In An Array:

Write a program to N numbers and fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 the print min element
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array:
10
Array Elements: 38 30 100 100 17 99 46 91 55 31
Min Number is: 17

## Problem4: Sum of Random Array

Write a program to N numbers and fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 then print sum of all elements
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array Elements are: 11 85 36 95 72 69 76 23 35 96
Sum of All Numbers is: 598

## Problem5: Average of Random Array

Write a program to N numbers and fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100 then print Average of elements
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array elements are: 83 58 66 19 64 85 76 83 37 16
Average of All Numbers is: 58.7

## Problem6: Copy Array

Write a program to fill array of max size of 100 with random numbers from 1 to 100 then copy it to another array and print them.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array Elements are: 24 56 77 23 15 88 84 6 82 34
Array Copy Elements are: 24 56 77 23 15 88 84 6 82 34

## Problem7: Copy Only Prime Elements In An Array

Write a program to fill array of max size of 100 with random numbers from 1 to 100 then copy only prime numbers to another array and print them.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array Elements are: 12 100 91 75 72 97 21 22 8 25
Array Copy Prime Elements are: 97

## Problem8: Sum TWO Arrays

Write a program to fill two arrays of max size of 100 with random numbers from 1 to 100 then Sum their elements in a third array and print them.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array 1 Elements:
31 91 21 84 86 27 2 97 2 72
Array 2 Elements:
21 87 40 47 100 19 87 68 34 57
Sum of Array 1 and Array 2:
52 178 61 131 186 46 89 165 36 129

## Problem9: Shuffle Array

Write a program to fill array with ordered numbers from 1 to N, then print it. After that shuffle the array and print it after shuffling.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array Before Shuffle:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Array After Shuffle:
1 2 10 4 5 3 7 6 9 8

## Problem10: Copy Array In Reversed Order

Write a program to fill array of max size of 100 with random numbers from 1 to 100 then copy it to another array in reverse and print them.
Example:
How many elements do you want in the array (1 to 100):
10
Array 1 Elements are:
68 34 66 5 63 62 70 54 33 65
Reversed Array Elements are:
65 33 54 70 62 63 5 66 34 68
