## new and delete:

Write a program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation in C++. Declare two pointers ptrX and ptrY for integer and float data types, respectively. Dynamically allocate memory for these pointers using the new operator. Assign values 15 to ptrX and 17.6 to ptrY. Display the memory addresses stored in ptrX and ptrY, as well as the values they point to. Finally, deallocate the dynamically allocated memory using the delete operator to free up the memory.

## Dynamic array:

Write a C++ program that allows the user to input the number of students' marks to be entered. Dynamically allocate memory for an array of floating-point numbers to store the marks. Prompt the user to input each student's marks and display the list of students along with their corresponding marks.
