# Bank Project Extension 1:

This project is an extension of the <a href = "https://github.com/Khadijarejjaoui99/CPlusPlus_Problems_and_Solutions/tree/main/CPlusPlus-Projects/Project-3">Project 3 Bank 1</a>, which is a console application created using C++. It incorporates several fundamental programming concepts such as structures, enums, vectors, and file handling. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way to manage a list of clients for a bank, with the addition of transaction functionalities.

## Concepts Used

The project continues to utilize the following programming concepts:

- **Structure**: Structures are used to define the client data structure, allowing for the organization of client information into a single entity.

- **Enum**: Enums are used to define constants like menu options, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Vector**: Vectors are employed to store and manage the list of clients.

- **Dealing with Files**: The project involves reading from and writing to files. File used in this project is "clients-list.txt".

## Functionalities

This Project offers the functionalities from the project 3 along with the following new transaction-related features:

### Transaction Menu

When the user selects option 6 from the main menu, a transaction menu appears with the following options:

1. **Deposit**: Users can deposit funds into an account.

2. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw funds from an account.

3. **Total Balances**: Users can check the total balances of all clients.

4. **Back to Main Menu**: Users can return to the main menu.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a main menu that includes the original functionalities described in the following <a href = "https://github.com/Khadijarejjaoui99/CPlusPlus_Problems_and_Solutions/blob/main/CPlusPlus-Projects/Project-3/README.md">README</a>. Additionally, if you choose option 6, you will access the transaction menu, where you can perform deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry operations.
