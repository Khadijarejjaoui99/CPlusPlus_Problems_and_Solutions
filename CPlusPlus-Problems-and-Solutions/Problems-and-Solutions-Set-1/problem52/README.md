## Problem #52: ATM PIN

Write a program to read ATM PIN code from the user, then check if the PIN code
= 1234, then show the balance to the user, otherwise print "Wrong PIN" and ask
the user to enter the PIN again.
Assume user balance is 7800.
Only allow the user to enter the 3 times. If fails, print "Card is Locked"
